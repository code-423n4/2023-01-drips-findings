The 'collect' function uses the 'safeTransfer' function to transfer the collected funds to the 'transferTo' address. The process works by using the 'safeTransfer' function, which only works if the token being transferred is a “safe” ERC-20 token, meaning it does not have any extra functionality or restrictions that could interfere with its transferability. If such additional features are present in the token then there is a risk that the transaction may fail and cause irreversible loss of funds for both parties involved in it.

One way of avoiding this issue when using 'collect' functions on Ethereum networks  would be to make sure all tokens used are compliant with ERC-20 standards before transferring them via 'safeTransfer' functions as these tokens ensure maximum compatibility between different platforms and wallets while also providing better security against malicious attacks on transactions due to their standardized structure and codebase requirements.
