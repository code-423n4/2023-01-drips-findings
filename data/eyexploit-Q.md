# 2. Lock pragmas to specific compiler version

Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally.

*Recommendation* 
Lock pragmas to specific compiler version.
