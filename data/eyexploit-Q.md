# 2. Lock pragmas to specific compiler version

Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally.

https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103
https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/locking-pragmas/

*Recommendation* 
Lock pragmas to specific compiler version.

# 3. Insufficient coverage

The test coverage rate of the project is 84%. Testing all functions is best practice in terms of security criteria.

Due to its capacity, test coverage is expected to be 100%.
