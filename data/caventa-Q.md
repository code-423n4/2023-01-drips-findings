For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments" (quote OpenZeppelin). Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts, potentially causing loss of user fund or cause the contract to malfunction completely.

Managed.sol should contain storage gap. The storage gap is essential for upgradeable contract because "It allows us to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments". Refer to the bottom part of this article:

Recommend adding an appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts such as the below. Please reference OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract templates.

uint256[50] private __gap;

As written in https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable

You can use your Solidity contracts with OpenZeppelin Upgrades without any modifications, except for their constructors. Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts. 

Recommend the following changes

+++ import {Initializable} from "openzeppelin-contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
--- abstract contract Managed is UUPSUpgradeable {
+++ abstract contract Managed is UUPSUpgradeable, Initializable {

--- constructor() {
---      _managedStorage().isPaused = true;
--- }

+++ function initialize() public initializer {
+++  _managedStorage().isPaused = true;
+++}

See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/upgradeable

If your contract is going to be deployed with upgradeability, such as using the OpenZeppelin Upgrades Plugins, you will need to use the Upgradeable variant of OpenZeppelin Contracts. This variant is available as a separate package called @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable, which is hosted in the repository OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable.

Apparently, 

Every openzeppelin object in AddressDriver and NFTDriver needs to use the upgradable variant as they extend from Managed.sol (Managed.sol is UUPS upgradable)

a.

Run forge install https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable

b. 

Add openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/ to remapping.txt

c. 

Change AddressDriver.sol

--- import {ERC2771Context} from "openzeppelin-contracts/metatx/ERC2771Context.sol";
+++ import {ERC2771ContextUpgradeable} from "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/metatx/ERC2771ContextUpgradeable.sol";

--- contract AddressDriver is Managed, ERC2771Context {
+++ contract AddressDriver is Managed, ERC2771ContextUpgradeable {

---   ERC2771Context(forwarder)
+++ ERC2771ContextUpgradeable(forwarder)

d.

Change NFTDriver.sol

--- import {Context, ERC2771Context} from "openzeppelin-contracts/metatx/ERC2771Context.sol";
--- import {IERC20, SafeERC20} from "openzeppelin-contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
--- import {StorageSlot} from "openzeppelin-contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol";
--- import {
---     ERC721,
---     ERC721Burnable,
---     IERC721
--- } from "openzeppelin-contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Burnable.sol";

+++ import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/metatx/ERC2771ContextUpgradeable.sol";
+++ import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol";
+++ import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721BurnableUpgradeable.sol";
+++ import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/utils/ContextUpgradeable.sol";
+++ import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/utils/StorageSlotUpgradeable.sol";
+++ import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol";
+++ import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/interfaces/IERC20Upgradeable.sol";
+++ import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol";

And refactor other openzeppelin objects accordingly (Add the word upgradable after the original variable names)
