For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments" (quote OpenZeppelin). Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts, potentially causing loss of user fund or cause the contract to malfunction completely.

Managed.sol should contain storage gap. The storage gap is essential for upgradeable contract because "It allows us to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments". Refer to the bottom part of this article:

Recommend adding an appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts such as the below. Please reference OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract templates.

uint256[50] private __gap;

As written in https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable

1. You can use your Solidity contracts with OpenZeppelin Upgrades without any modifications, except for their constructors. Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts. 

2. When writing an initializer, you need to take special care to manually call the initializers of all parent contracts. Also, Openzeppelin has a contracts wizard feature that allows users to use the interactive generator to bootstrap contracts (See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard). In the wizard page, try to click the UUPS checkbox, you can see the following code

Recommend changing from

constructor() {
     _managedStorage().isPaused = true;
}

to 

function initialize() public initializer {
  _managedStorage().isPaused = true;
  __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
}
