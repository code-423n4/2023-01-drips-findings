## Interfaces and libraries should be separately saved and imported
Some contracts have interface(s) or libraries showing up in its/their entirety at the top/bottom of the contract facilitating an ease of references on the same file page. This has, in certain instances, made the already large contract size to house an excessive code base. Additionally, it might create difficulty locating them when attempting to cross reference the specific interfaces embedded elsewhere but not saved into a particular .sol file.

Consider saving the interfaces and libraries entailed respectively, and having them imported like all other files.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

## Solidity's Style Guide on contract layout
According to Solidity's Style Guide below:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html

In order to help readers identify which functions they can call, and find the constructor and fallback definitions more easily, functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered in the following manner:

constructor, receive function (if exists), fallback function (if exists), external, public, internal, private

And, within a grouping, place the view and pure functions last.

Additionally, inside each contract, library or interface, use the following order:

type declarations, state variables, events, modifiers, functions

Consider adhering to the above guidelines for all contract instances entailed.
